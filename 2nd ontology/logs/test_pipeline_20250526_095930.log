2025-05-26 09:59:30,889 - __main__ - INFO - 1. PRESERVED BOTH COMPETENCY QUESTIONS:
2025-05-26 09:59:30,889 - __main__ - INFO -    - Kept :hasPostureIndicator and :signalsTransitionTo for posture indicators
2025-05-26 09:59:30,889 - __main__ - INFO -    - Kept :hasMethod and :identifiesDrowsiness for detection methodologies
2025-05-26 09:59:30,889 - __main__ - INFO - 2. ELIMINATED DUPLICATES THROUGH CONSOLIDATION:
2025-05-26 09:59:30,889 - __main__ - INFO -    - Merged duplicate Drowsiness classes
2025-05-26 09:59:30,889 - __main__ - INFO -    - Consolidated similar detection methodology classes
2025-05-26 09:59:30,889 - __main__ - INFO -    - Used authorized patterns as canonical sources
2025-05-26 09:59:30,889 - __main__ - INFO - 3. MAINTAINED CLEAR NAMING AND RELATIONSHIPS:
2025-05-26 09:59:30,889 - __main__ - INFO -    - Used consistent rdfs:label and rdfs:comment for all entities
2025-05-26 09:59:30,889 - __main__ - INFO -    - Maintained logical hierarchy (Drowsiness -> InattentionState -> CognitiveState)
2025-05-26 09:59:30,889 - __main__ - INFO -    - Incorporated naming conventions from authorized patterns
2025-05-26 09:59:30,889 - __main__ - INFO - 4. BALANCED EXPRESSIVITY WITH SIMPLICITY:
2025-05-26 09:59:30,889 - __main__ - INFO -    - Kept essential restrictions for both competency questions
2025-05-26 09:59:30,889 - __main__ - INFO -    - Avoided over-complex property chains
2025-05-26 09:59:30,889 - __main__ - INFO -    - Reused proven patterns from authorized sources
2025-05-26 09:59:30,889 - __main__ - INFO - 5. USED INVERSE PROPERTIES TO REDUCE REDUNDANCY:
2025-05-26 09:59:30,889 - __main__ - INFO -    - Added owl:inverseOf declarations for :identifiesDrowsiness/:hasMethod
2025-05-26 09:59:30,889 - __main__ - INFO -    - Added owl:inverseOf declarations for :signalsTransitionTo/:hasPostureIndicator
2025-05-26 09:59:30,889 - __main__ - INFO -    - Applied inverse property patterns from authorized patterns
