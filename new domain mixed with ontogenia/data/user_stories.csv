US1,"Michael is driving home after a long workday, traveling on a highway for over two hours. As night falls, his Driver parameters begin to change—his PostureState dct:hasPart Head Position which ssn:hasProperty Nodding patterns. The Detection methodologies dct:requires Driver-facing Visual sensors where Cameras ssn:observes Eye tracking metrics and ssn:madeObservation of reduced attention. The Physiological Sensors dct:hasPart Electroencephalogram (EEG) which ssn:observes Drowsiness, and Respiration sensors which ssn:observes Fatigue, both rdf:type individuals of CognitiveState.
The Vehicle system (HMI) schema:provides Visual feedback where Display Types prov:wasInfluencedBy the detected driver state by increasing brightness and Visual Elements prov:wasInfluencedBy contrast adjustments. When Head Position ssn:hasProperty increased Nodding patterns frequency, the Vehicle system (HMI) schema:provides Tactile feedback through Haptic Alerts dct:isPartOf the steering wheel, while Audio feedback dct:hasPart Auditory Displays which prov:generated increased volume for navigation prompts. The Wording dct:hasPart Dialog Design which prov:generated a gentle voice alert with Message Structure: 'Would you like to find a rest area nearby?'
When Vehicle Data Analysis dct:hasPart Steering Behavior Analysis which ssn:madeObservation that Michael passes a highway exit without signaling—behavior deviating from normal Lanekeeping patterns—the Vehicle system (HMI) schema:provides Tactile feedback where Force Feedback prov:wasInfluencedBy Driver state adaptation rules, intensifying in the steering wheel, and Visual feedback prov:generated a prominent alert showing rest stop distance."
